Pleiades is used for data analysis of astronomical data from NASA. One of the data that are analyzed is finding exoplanets by looking at the star data for any dips stars output from a lot of astronomical pictures. This technique can identify if the stars have any exoplanets and have identified several exoplanets and have found several thousand candidate stars that might have exoplanets.

1. # PARAM Siddhi-AI Supercomputer
PARAM Siddi-AI is built on the legacy of PARAM, which is the first Indian supercomputer PARAM 8000. PARAM Siddi-AI is used in CDAC.
